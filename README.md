# Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Disease Risk Factors

This project involves an exploratory data analysis conducted in R on a large public health dataset containing over 300,000 observations from Kaggle. The dataset includes demographic and behavioral variables such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and more. The objective of this EDA is to identify patterns and correlations between these factors and the likelihood of having heart disease.

Using tools such as `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualization, the project cleans and processes the raw data, generates descriptive statistics, and produces visual summaries to highlight relationships between key variables. The analysis includes comparisons across age groups, BMI categories, gender, and lifestyle choices to uncover meaningful insights about who is most at risk of developing heart disease.

# Research Questions
- What are the lifestyle choices that affect an individual's risk for heart disease? 
- How does heart disease prevalence vary across different age groups?
- Who is at the greatest risk for heart disease? (by gender, weight, activity level, etc.)

# Summary of Findings
The analysis shows that heart disease is more prevalent among males, older adults, individuals classified as obese or overweight, and those who smoke or are physically inactive. Age is one of the strongest predictors, with risk increasing consistently in higher age categories. These insights support the importance of lifestyle interventions and preventative health measures targeting at-risk groups.
